## 1. iOS Stacking Context & CSS Positioning

### 1.1 `position: fixed` + `body { position: fixed }` → Click Dead Zones

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🔴 Critical (all UI unclickable) |
| **Root Cause** | `body { position: fixed; }` on iOS Safari causes all child elements to lose correct click areas. `position: fixed` forces a new containing block that clips/intercepts pointer events. |
| **Fix** | Replace `body { position: fixed; width: 100%; }` with `overflow: hidden`. The layout wrapper (`.layout`) handles positioning with `position: relative`. |
| **Platforms** | iOS PWA only (desktop Chrome fine) |
| **Prevention** | Never set `position: fixed` on `<body>`. Use a wrapper div with `position: relative; overflow: hidden;` instead. |

### 1.2 Leaflet Tile Pane z-index Override

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🔴 Critical (modals invisible behind map) |
| **Root Cause** | Leaflet internally sets `z-index: 200` on `.leaflet-tile-pane` and uses GPU compositing (`translate3d`). CSS overlays with `z-index: 100` render **behind** the map tiles. |
| **Fix** | Raise `.fixed-modal-layer` to `z-index: 9999`. Add `isolation: isolate` to force a fresh stacking context. |
| **Prevention** | Always set modal z-index above 200 when Leaflet is present. Verify with DevTools > Computed > z-index. |

### 1.3 `!important` Blocking Inline Override

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🟠 Medium (layout misalignment) |
| **Root Cause** | CSS class `.fixed-modal-layer` had `inset: 0 !important`. Inline `style={{ bottom: '85px' }}` could NOT override because `!important` in CSS class > inline style without `!important`. |
| **Fix** | Remove `!important` from positioning properties (`inset`, `top`, `left`, `right`, `bottom`). Keep `!important` only on `position: fixed` and `z-index`. |
| **Prevention** | CSS discipline: `!important` only on properties that must **never** be overridden. Layout/positioning properties should always be overrideable. |

### 1.4 React Portal Wrapper → Blank Screen

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🔴 Critical (nothing clickable) |
| **Root Cause** | ModalPortal component rendered a persistent wrapper div (even when modal closed) that covered the entire screen, intercepting all pointer events. |
| **Fix** | Return `null` when no children, or use pure `createPortal(children, document.body)` without wrapper. |
| **Code** | `ModalPortal.tsx`: `if (!mounted) return null; return createPortal(children, document.body)` — no wrapper div. |

### 1.5 `body { position: fixed }` + Modal Portal

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🔴 Critical (modal content invisible behind map) |
| **Root Cause** | `body { position: fixed; }` creates a new containing block in iOS Safari. Elements rendered via `createPortal` to `document.body` get positioned relative to the fixed body, not the viewport. |
| **Fix** | Remove `body { position: fixed; }` entirely. Replace with `overflow: hidden`. |
| **Platforms** | iOS Safari / PWA only |
| **Prevention** | Test modal overlays on actual iOS device after every CSS change to `body` or `html`. |

## 2. Modal/Popup Stacking & Overlap

### 2.0 Egg Encounter No Popup (Silent Save)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🟡 Medium (user can't see egg found) |
| **Root Cause** | `addSt()` egg encounter only called `addPixelLabEgg()` → `logMsg()` + `setTab('eggs')`. No UI confirmation — user might not notice they found an egg. |
| **Fix** | Add `eggFoundData` state. When egg triggers: save to DB, then show popup with 🥚 icon, egg name, rarity badge, and two buttons (收埋 / 去蛋頁面孵化). |
| **Prevention** | Any "item acquired" event must show a visible popup/notification, not just a log message. |

### 2.0.1 Event & Egg Trigger Simultaneously (Queue Missing)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🟡 Medium (one modal lost behind other) |
| **Root Cause** | Both event check and egg check run synchronously in `addSt()`. If both trigger, only `setCurrentEvent(ev)` runs (event shows). Egg is saved silently — no popup ever appears. |
| **Fix** | Add `pendingEggRef` and `pendingEventRef` (useRef). If both trigger: show event, queue egg. On event dismiss (`handleEventChoice`): check `pendingEggRef` and show egg popup. If egg showing and event triggers: queue event in `pendingEventRef`. On egg dismiss (`dismissEggFound`): check `pendingEventRef` and show event. |
| **Prevention** | Any system with multiple independent modal triggers must have a queue/priority mechanism. Never assume only one modal type will fire at a time. |

### 2.1 Multiple Popups Overlapping

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🟡 Medium (two modals at once) |
| **Symptom** | Event popup appears behind new-pet popup (or vice versa) |
| **Root Cause** | Both modals render simultaneously — their `if (state)` conditions both return true. |
| **Fix** | Auto-dismiss lower-priority popup before showing new one. In `addSt()`: `if (newPetId) dismissNewPet()` before `setCurrentEvent()`. |
| **Prevention** | Before opening any modal, explicitly close conflicting modals. Never assume only one modal will be open at a time. |

### 2.2 Popup Not Dismissing (Reopening on Re-render)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🟠 Medium (annoying UX) |
| **Root Cause** | `useEffect` auto-detect re-detected the same pet as "new" after each render because it only checked `createdAt`, not a dismissal set. |
| **Fix** | Add `dismissedNewPets` ref Set. Auto-detect effect checks `!dismissedNewPets.current.has(p.id)` before setting `newPetId`. On dismiss: add pet ID to the set. |
| **Prevention** | Any auto-detect "new item" feature needs a dismissal tracker (ref Set), not just a boolean state. |

### 2.3 Notification Modal Covers Bottom Nav

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🟠 Medium (nav hidden) |
| **Root Cause** | Modal used `position: fixed; inset: 0` which covers the entire viewport, including the bottom navigation bar. |
| **Fix** | Override bottom edge: `bottom: 85px` + `height: calc(100dvh - 85px)` on the notification modal specifically. This leaves space for the bottom nav. |
| **Prevention** | Full-screen modals with bottom nav: either (a) render nav at higher z-index, or (b) limit modal bottom to leave nav visible. Option (b) is cleaner. |

## 3. Stale Closure & React Refs

### 3.1 setInterval Stale State

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🟠 Medium (simulation uses stale values) |
| **Symptom** | Walk simulation interval shows old step count, doesn't trigger events correctly |
| **Root Cause** | `setInterval` callback captures closure variables at creation time. When state changes, the interval still sees old values. |
| **Fix** | Store critical functions in `useRef`: `addStRef.current = addSt`. Simulation reads `addStRef.current(steps)` instead of `addSt(steps)`. |
| **Prevention** | Any `setInterval`/`setTimeout` that reads state MUST use refs for the state/function it calls. |

### 3.2 GPS watchPosition Closure

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🔴 Critical (steps not counting correctly) |
| **Root Cause** | `navigator.geolocation.watchPosition` callback captures `addSt` / `pets` / `user` at subscription time. After re-render, these are stale. |
| **Fix** | Use refs for ALL state read inside `watchPosition` callback: `stepsRef`, `userRef`, `petsRef`. Read from `.current` when computing steps. |
| **Prevention** | Any callback registered with browser API (`watchPosition`, `setInterval`, `addEventListener`, `requestAnimationFrame`) must use refs, not closure variables. |

### 3.3 Event Check Used `pet` Instead of `petRef`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🟡 Medium (event fails silently) |
| **Root Cause** | `if (... && pet)` inside `addSt()` — `pet` is a render-cycle variable that's stale inside the state-update callback. |
| **Fix** | Use `petRef.current` for all checks inside `addSt()`. |
| **Prevention** | In any function that's called from effects/timers: use refs for reading state, not render-cycle variables. |

## 4. GPS Tracking Issues

### 4.1 Spurious Step Counting (GPS Drift)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🟠 Medium (inaccurate steps) |
| **Causes** | GPS noise — even standing still, coordinates can drift 5-20m, causing phantom steps |
| **Fix (multi-layer):** | |
| | 1. **Warmup**: Skip first 5 GPS readings (sensor stabilization) |
| | 2. **Accuracy gate**: Ignore readings with `accuracy > 50m` |
| | 3. **Speed check**: Ignore if `speed < 0.5 m/s` (~1.8 km/h — user isn't walking) |
| | 4. **Time gate**: Ignore updates faster than 3s apart |
| | 5. **Min displacement**: Only count steps when `distance > 5m` from last valid point |
| **Prevention** | ALL 5 filters must be implemented together. Any single one is insufficient. |

### 4.2 Steps Formula

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🟢 Info (calibration) |
| **Formula** | `steps = floor(distance_in_meters × 1300)` — 1 meter ≈ 1.3 steps. |
| **Method** | Haversine formula for distance between two lat/lng coordinates. |
| **Prevention** | Store step count as integer. Use `Math.floor` to avoid floating-point accumulation. |

### 4.3 GPS Not Available on Simulators

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🟢 Info (dev only) |
| **Solution** | Dev Tools provide walk **simulation** + manual step injection (+500, +10K buttons) so developers can test without real GPS. |
| **Prevention** | Always provide manual test controls alongside GPS-dependent features. |

---

## 5. Database & API

### 5.1 Market Buy Race Condition

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🟠 Medium (double-buy possible) |
| **Root Cause** | No atomic transaction — SELECT balance → deduct → UPDATE → transfer pet. Two concurrent buys could pass the balance check. |
| **Fix** | `/api/market` buy endpoint uses `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` with a **stored procedure** or **transaction block** to atomically check balance, deduct, and transfer ownership. |
| **Prevention** | Any "deduct + transfer" operation MUST be atomic. Use stored procedures or Supabase RPC with transaction isolation. |

### 5.6 Property Transfer Atomicity

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🟠 Medium (steps lost or double-spent) |
| **Root Cause** | If the transfer flow deducts steps from buyer BEFORE crediting seller (non-atomic), a crash between the two operations permanently loses the buyer's steps. |
| **Fix** | `POST /api/properties/transfer` uses Supabase RPC in a single transaction: check buyer balance → deduct → credit seller → transfer property → unlist — all in one `rpc()` call. See `apps/web/src/app/api/properties/transfer/route.ts`. |
| **Prevention** | Any two-step financial transaction MUST be wrapped in a database transaction or RPC. Never use separate client-side API calls for deduct + credit. |

### 5.7 UPDATE RLS Must Be Explicit

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🟡 Medium (cannot list/unlist) |
| **Root Cause** | The original `properties` table had only `SELECT` and `INSERT` RLS policies. The new `PATCH` endpoint for listing/unlisting silently failed because users could not UPDATE their own rows. |
| **Fix** | Add explicit `CREATE POLICY "Users can update own properties" ON properties FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id)` — grants UPDATE on user's own rows only. |
| **Prevention** | Any new mutation API must be checked against existing RLS policies. Adding a PATCH or PUT endpoint requires a corresponding UPDATE policy in Supabase. |

### 5.8 profiles LEFT JOIN RLS Block

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🟠 Medium (properties invisible in Community tab) |
| **Root Cause** | `loadAllListedProperties()` used `.select('*, profiles(username)')` to get seller usernames. The `profiles` table RLS policy (`auth.uid() = id`) blocks reading OTHER users' profile rows. In Supabase, LEFT JOIN + RLS on the joined table can silently drop the **entire parent row** — not just the joined fields. |
| **Fix** | Remove the `profiles` join entirely: `.select('*')`. Seller names are not shown; cards display "由賣家出售" instead. |
| **Prevention** | When using Supabase client-side joins (`db()` with RLS), understand that RLS on the joined table can filter out rows from the parent query. Use the service role API route pattern (`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`) when cross-user data access is required. |

### 5.2 Pet Skills Lost on Hard Refresh

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🔴 Critical (pets lose abilities) |
| **Root Cause** | Database `pets` table had **no `skills` column**. `petToDb()` never saved skills; `dbToPet()` returned `skills: []`. |
| **Fix** | Add JSONB `skills` column to `pets` table. Serialize/deserialize in `petToDb()`/`dbToPet()`. |
| **Prevention** | Any new non-trivial field must be added to DB schema AND both serialization functions simultaneously. |

### 5.3 Evolution Steps Inflation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🟡 Medium (wrong step counts) |
| **Root Cause** | Evolution didn't deduct the required steps from the pet's `totalSteps`. The accumulated steps persisted, making the next evolution require fewer new steps. |
| **Fix** | `remainingSteps = pet.totalSteps - EVOLUTION_STEPS[currentStage + 1]` — deduct the stage requirement from the pet's steps on evolution. |
| **Prevention** | Any "upgrade/rank-up" system must subtract the resource cost, not just check it. |

### 5.4 Auth Callback Null User

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🔴 Critical (can't login) |
| **Root Cause** | Server-side `/api/auth/callback` always returned `null user` because Supabase session cookies aren't available on server routes in Next.js App Router. |
| **Fix** | Move auth to **client-side**: `exchangeCodeForSession()` in a client component (`useEffect` on mount). The callback route just redirects to `/`. |
| **Prevention** | Next.js App Router server routes cannot read Supabase auth cookies. Always handle Supabase auth callbacks on the client. |

### 5.5 Duplicate Profile (upsert Race)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🟠 Medium (duplicate key errors) |
| **Root Cause** | `SELECT` then `INSERT/UPDATE` has a TOCTOU race — two simultaneous logins create duplicate profiles. |
| **Fix** | Use PostgreSQL `upsert()` (INSERT ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE) in a single query. `ensureProfile()` now uses `.upsert()` with `onConflict: 'id'`. |
| **Prevention** | Never SELECT-then-INSERT. Always use upsert. |

### 5.6 Property API Wrong URL Path

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🟡 Medium (property popup shows no buy button) |
| **Root Cause** | `RealMap.tsx` called `fetch('/api/properties/check?anchor_lat=...&...)`. The actual route is at `/api/properties` (GET handler), not `/api/properties/check`. |
| **Fix** | Use `fetch('/api/properties?anchor_lat=...&anchor_lng=...&cell_row=...&cell_col=...')` directly. |
| **Prevention** | When adding new API routes, verify the exact URL path matches the file structure in `app/api/`. Next.js `app/api/properties/route.ts` only creates `/api/properties`, not sub-paths. |

---

## 6. Pixel Art & UI Rendering

### 6.1 PICO-8 Gray Background Remnants

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🟠 Medium (white dots on dark bg) |
| **Root Cause** | PICO-8 sprites have `rgb(194,195,199)` (light gray) pixels that appear as "white dots" on the dark app background. |
| **Fix** | (1) Bulk-remove `#C2C3C7` pixels → transparent in all 50 sprite files. (2) Add `removeBg()` render-time safety net: both `PixelPetCanvas.tsx` and `PetCompanion.tsx` strip `(194,195,199)` at draw time. (3) Cache-bust via `SPRITE_VERSION` bump. |
| **Prevention** | Any sprite with a fixed palette (PICO-8, retro) must have its "background" colour explicitly mapped to transparent. |

### 6.2 Pixel Art Blurred on Canvas

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🟡 Medium (blurry pixels) |
| **Root Cause** | Canvas default `imageSmoothingEnabled = true` uses bilinear interpolation, blurring pixel art. |
| **Fix** | `ctx.imageSmoothingEnabled = false` on both canvas renderers (`PetCompanion.tsx`, `PixelPetCanvas.tsx`). |
| **Prevention** | Always disable image smoothing on any canvas that renders pixel art. |

### 6.3 Sprite Flash on Tab Switch

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🟢 Minor (visual glitch) |
| **Root Cause** | React reused the canvas DOM element when pet changed, so old sprite briefly showed before new pet loaded. |
| **Fix** | Add `key={pet.id}` to every `PixelPetCanvas` instance — React unmounts/remounts canvas when pet changes, preventing stale sprite flash. |
| **Prevention** | Any canvas that displays dynamic data needs a unique `key` prop to force proper remounting. |

### 6.4 Walk Animation Flip (Wrong Direction)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🟠 Medium (pet walks backwards) |
| **Causes** | Multiple regressions: |
| | 1. Flip logic inverted (`if (facingLeft) scale(-1,1)` vs `if (!facingLeft) scale(-1,1)`) |
| | 2. Merge conflict re-introduced old lateral sway (`xOff = dir * 6`) |
| | 3. PNG sprite path didn't flip at all for generic species |
| **Fix** | Per-species facing detection: Cat frames face RIGHT, Shiba/generic face LEFT. Combined `shouldFlip` condition for both canvas and PNG paths. |
| **Prevention** | When fixing flip animations, verify BOTH rendering paths (canvas grid + PNG sprite) and ALL species. Write a visual regression test. |

### 6.5 Map Compass / Heading Arrow Misaligned

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🟡 Medium (arrow direction wrong or jittery) |
| **Symptom** | The direction arrow on the map marker either points the wrong way, jitters erratically, or has a rotated/offset pivot point |
| **Root Cause** | Three independent issues: |
| | 1. **CSS border triangle** had unpredictable `transform-origin` — the visual arrow didn't rotate around its centre, causing offset/pivot misalignment |
| | 2. **`pos.coords.heading`** (device compass heading) is unreliable — many devices return `null`, 0, or wildly fluctuating values, especially when phone orientation changes |
| | 3. **Arrow and circle rotated separately** — if only the arrow rotates inside a fixed circle container, there's a visual disconnect and the arrow can clip against the circle edge |
| **Fix** | |
| | 1. **SVG `<path>` arrow** instead of CSS border triangle — explicit `viewBox="0 0 16 12"` with `M8 0L16 12H0z` triangle, no transform-origin ambiguity |
| | 2. **GPS trajectory heading** (`atan2(dLng, dLat)`) instead of `pos.coords.heading` — compute actual movement direction from successive GPS position deltas |
| | 3. **Min 1m displacement gate** — discard tiny GPS fluctuations (<1m) that cause 180° heading flips when standing still |
| | 4. **Arrow + circle in same wrapper `<div>`** — `rotate()` on the parent div rotates both the SVG arrow AND the circular container together as one unit, preventing visual disconnect |
| **Prevention** | Never trust `pos.coords.heading` for walking direction — compute heading from `atan2(dLng, dLat)` with a min-displacement threshold. Use SVG `<path>` for direction indicators, not CSS border triangles. Wrap all marker elements in a single container for rotation.

## 7. Performance & Build

### 7.1 Vercel Build Cache Stale Env Vars

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🔴 Critical (wrong env vars deployed) |
| **Root Cause** | `vercel link` command wipes environment variables. `vercel env add` with project scope doesn't override old values. |
| **Fix** | Use `--value` flag for `vercel env add` commands. Avoid running `vercel link` on production projects. Use `vercel env pull` to inspect current values before modifying. |

### 7.2 vercel.json Conflicting with Dashboard Settings

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🔴 Critical (deploy failure) |
| **Root Cause** | Committing `vercel.json` with framework config that conflicts with Vercel Dashboard settings. |
| **Fix** | Remove `vercel.json` from repo. Configure all build settings through Vercel Dashboard only. |
| **Prevention** | Don't commit `vercel.json` unless you exclusively use CLI-based configuration. |

### 7.3 Service Worker Caching Stale Assets

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🟠 Medium (users see old sprites) |
| **Root Cause** | PWA service worker has cache-first strategy. When sprites change, users served stale cached versions until SW is manually updated. |
| **Fix** | Version cache name: `pipz-v1` → `pipz-v2` on SPRITE_VERSION bump. Users get fresh assets on next page load. |
| **Prevention** | Version the service worker cache name with each asset update. Never use a static cache name. |

---

## 8. TypeScript & Build

### 8.1 Stale Canvas on Pet Tab Switch

Similar to 6.3 — resolved via `key={pet.id}`.

### 8.2 Missing `skills` Field in Pet (see 5.2)

---

## 9. Git & Collaboration

### 9.1 Merge Conflict Re-introducing Bugs

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🟠 Medium (regression) |
| **Symptom** | Multiple occasions where a merge of two branches re-introduced code that had been intentionally removed, such as lateral sway `xOff = dir * 6` and flip animation logic. |
| **Fix** | After every merge, review the **diff** between the merged result and each parent branch. Auto-merge can silently resurrect dead code. |
| **Prevention** | Run `git diff <parent1>..HEAD` and `git diff <parent2>..HEAD` after merge commits. Verify intentional deletions are still absent. |

### 9.2 `.gitignore` for Generated Files

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🟢 Minor |
| **Prevention** | Always add `*.bak`, `*.log`, `.env.local`, `.env.production` to `.gitignore` early. Retroactive cleanup pollutes commit history. |

---

## 12. React useRef + useState Sync Timing (Stale Ref)

### 12.1 Grid Toggle `gridVisibleRef` Read Before Render

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🟠 Medium (toggle button doesn't show grid) |
| **Root Cause** | `gridVisibleRef.current = gridVisible` is set during render. When `onClick` → `setGridVisible(true)` is called, React schedules a re-render but hasn't executed it yet. A subsequent call to `updateGrid()` that reads `gridVisibleRef.current` sees the OLD value (`false`) and exits early. |
| **Fix** | Sync the ref synchronously in the onClick handler BEFORE the action: `gridVisibleRef.current = newVal; setGridVisible(newVal); ... updateGrid(...)` — ensures the ref is up-to-date for any function called in the same tick. |
| **Prevention** | When using `useRef` as a "mirror" of `useState` for use in callbacks/event handlers, always update the ref synchronously in the same event handler that calls `setState`, not just in the render body. The render body sync (`gridVisibleRef.current = gridVisible`) only guarantees consistency for the render itself, not for functions called between `setState` and the next render. |

### 12.2 Zoom Auto-Toggle-Off Overriding Manual Toggle

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🟡 Medium (toggle button to show grid while zoomed out has no effect) |
| **Root Cause** | When `updateGrid()` detects `zoomFactor ≤ 0`, it auto-toggles `gridVisible` to `false`. If the user presses the toggle button to show while zoomed out, the same `updateGrid()` call (triggered by the toggle) immediately auto-toggles back off. |
| **Fix** | Add a `fromToggle` parameter to `updateGrid()`. When `true`, skip the auto-toggle-off logic. Call `updateGrid(map, anchor, true)` from the manual toggle button, and `updateGrid(map, anchor)` from zoom/move events (use default `false`). |
| **Prevention** | Any "auto state change" logic in shared functions needs a way to distinguish between user-triggered and system-triggered calls. Use an optional parameter (e.g. `fromUser = false`) that callers set appropriately. |

---

## 11. Canvas Overlay Grid — Container Coordinate Drift

### 11.1 Grid Cells Drifting During Map Pan

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🟡 Medium (grid not anchored to geographic coordinates) |
| **Root Cause** | Direct canvas overlay was positioned over the map container and drawn using `map.latLngToContainerPoint()`. During pan, Leaflet transforms the tile pane via CSS `translate3d` but the canvas itself doesn't participate in the transform — it stays fixed at `[0,0]` in the container. Even with `move` event + `rAF` redraw, the canvas coordinate system doesn't perfectly track the map's internal offset, causing visible drift. |
| **Fix** | Revert to Leaflet vector layers (`L.Rectangle` per-cell). Each rectangle is a geographic feature added to Leaflet's overlay pane — Leaflet automatically handles all CSS transforms during pan/zoom/fly. No per-frame redraw needed. |
| **Prevention** | Never use a bare `<canvas>` element positioned outside Leaflet's overlay pane for geographic rendering. Always use `L.GridLayer`, `L.Rectangle`, or other native Leaflet layers. Canvas overlays break because they don't participate in Leaflet's coordinate transform pipeline. |

### 11.2 Grid Not Visible During `flyTo` Animation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🟡 Medium (grid hidden mid-animation) |
| **Root Cause** | Canvas overlay only redrew on `moveend`/`zoomend` events. `flyTo()` and `setView({ animate: true })` trigger `move` but `moveend` only fires when the animation completes. Mid-flight, the canvas kept the old content — invisible because the geographic area moved away. |
| **Fix** | Revert to `L.Rectangle` — Leaflet renders vector layers during all animation phases. |
| **Prevention** | Any custom rendering that depends on `moveend` will be invisible during Leaflet animations. Use native Leaflet layers or hook into `move` events with aggressive redraw. |

### 11.3 Canvas Overlay Has No Per-Cell Interactivity

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🟢 Minor (no hover/click per cell) |
| **Root Cause** | A single `<canvas>` element cannot have per-polygon click targets. All grid interaction had to be handled through the map's `click` event and manual `getCellInfo()` coordinate detection. |
| **Fix** | Each `L.Rectangle` has its own `click`, `mouseover`, `mouseout` events. Hover tooltip + click highlight animation + Leaflet popup — all native. |
| **Verification** | Pan map → grid stays with geographic landmarks. Click any cell → highlight + popup. Scroll/zoom → no gaps. |

### 11.4 Grid Anchor Instability (Multi-Player) — FIXED v0.35.0

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🔴 Critical (properties scatter across different geographic areas per device/session) |
| **Root Cause** | Grid anchor was dynamically set from the user's first GPS fix (`roundToGrid(lat, lng)` → saved to server via `POST /api/grid-config`). This meant: (1) Different devices at different locations would set different anchors; (2) Same user on different days (different starting GPS) could trigger anchor re-initialization. Properties bought under anchor A would appear in a completely different location when viewed under anchor B. By the time this was discovered, 50 properties existed across **6 different anchors**. |
| **Fix** | (1) Hard-code a single constant `GRID_ANCHOR = {lat: 22.3752, lng: 114.1134}` in `RealMap.tsx`. (2) Remove `fetchGridAnchor()` / `setGridAnchor()` / `roundToGrid()` — client no longer fetches or sets the anchor. (3) SQL migration: for each of the 50 properties, calculate its actual center `(anchor_lat + row * CELL_SIZE_DEG + CELL_SIZE_DEG/2)`, then recalculate row/col relative to the unified anchor. Resolved 3 duplicate-cell conflicts by shifting to nearest free cell. (4) Fixed `fetchLocationName()` — was passing just the anchor lat/lng to the geocoding API; now passes the property's actual **cell center** coordinates so location names are correct. |
| **Prevention** | Anchor must be a **compile-time constant** for any grid-based multi-player game. Never derive the anchor from a runtime value (GPS fix, user input, etc.). If the anchor needs to change, plan a coordinated data migration that recalculates all property positions. |

## 10. GPS Warmup + Map Animation Interference

### 10.1 Warmup Positions Interrupting `fitBounds` Animation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🟡 Medium (initial zoom animation never completes) |
| **Symptom** | When opening the app with saved trails, the map zooms way out (fitBounds) but never zooms back in to the user's current location. The flyTo timeout is silently lost. |
| **Root Cause** | GPS warmup (5 readings at ~1s intervals) calls `setMapPos` for each reading. This triggers the position-sync `useEffect`, which calls `map.setView(position, zoom, { animate: true })`. This Leaflet API calls `map.stop()` internally, which **interrupts the fitBounds animation mid-flight**. Since fitBounds never completes its zoom change, the `zoomend` event never fires. The `map.once('zoomend', ...)` listener that starts the 1.5s timeout → `flyTo()` sequence never fires, so the zoom-in animation is permanently lost. |
| **Fix (two-part)** | |
| | 1. **Remove `setMapPos` during warmup** (`page.tsx`): Warmup readings only update `last.current` (heading reference). The map doesn't update until the 6th reading (first real GPS fix). |
| | 2. **`initialAnimBusyRef` guard** (`RealMap.tsx`): A ref flag that's `true` from `fitBounds` start until `flyTo` completes. During this window, the position-sync effect skips `map.setView()` entirely (`else if (!initialAnimBusyRef.current)`), protecting the animation sequence from being interrupted by subsequent position updates. |
| **Prevention** | Any Leaflet animation sequence that uses `map.once('zoomend', callback)` must be protected against `setView`/`setZoom`/`fitBounds` calls that might fire during the animation. Use a busy flag ref that blocks view-altering operations during multi-step animation chains. Beware that Leaflet's `setView({ animate: true })` calls `map.stop()` which aborts *any* in-progress animation including fitBounds. |

## Quick Reference: Bug Patterns by Platform

| Pattern | Likely Platforms | Key Fix |
|---------|-----------------|---------|
| `position: fixed` on `<body>` | iOS PWA | Use `overflow: hidden` instead |
| Leaflet z-index < 200 | iOS + Android | Set modal z-index to 9999 |
| Stale closure in browser API callbacks | All | Use `useRef` for all closure reads |
| `setInterval` stale state | All | Ref the callback function |
| Missing DB column for new field | All | Add column + serialize/deserialize at the same time |
| TOCTOU race in DB operations | All | Use upsert/atomic transactions |
| Pixel art blurring | All | `imageSmoothingEnabled = false` |
| `!important` blocking overrides | All | Only use `!important` on truly invariant properties |
| Merge conflict resurrecting dead code | All | Manual review of merge diffs |
| Speed gate blocks map position (stationary marker never appears) | All | Separate position update from step counting gates. Call `setMapPos` before the speed/time/displacement checks so the marker shows even when stationary. |
| GPS cold-start jump causes 100k+ phantom steps in one reading | All | Move accuracy check AFTER warmup; first post-warmup reading sets reference point without counting steps |
| `pos.coords.speed === null` on iPhone leads to `'stationary'` mode blocking all steps | iOS | Default movement mode to `'walk'` when speed is unavailable; only gate on `stationary` / `vehicle` when speed is explicitly known |
| iOS `DeviceOrientationEvent.requestPermission()` silent fails in React useEffect / synthetic onClick | iOS | Use native DOM `document.addEventListener('click', grant, { once: true })` — iOS only recognises direct DOM event for permission prompts |
| Concurrent state updates (popups) | All | Dismiss old before showing new |
| Silent item acquisition (no popup) | All | Always show visible confirmation for acquired items |
| Multiple independent modal triggers | All | Use ref-based queue system with pending refs |
|| Map compass arrow direction/wrong pivot | All | SVG path + GPS trajectory heading (`atan2`) + same-container rotate |
||| **ModalPortal animation creates click trap on grandchildren** | All | Fade-in/out animation (`opacity: 0` + rAF state machine) created a transparent overlay that trapped clicks. `pointer-events: none` does NOT cascade to grandchildren — `.fixed-modal-layer` had default `pointer-events: auto` and intercepted all clicks during the animation window. Repeated cycles accumulated timing race conditions causing cards to become permanently unresponsive after 4-5 opens. **Fix:** Remove all animation from ModalPortal. Render children instantly with no transition or state machine. Verified: 30-cycle stress test at 50ms intervals. (`src/components/ModalPortal.tsx` v0.35.4) |
|| **Map auto-centers on every GPS update, ignores user pan** | All | `else if (!initialAnimBusyRef.current) { map.setView([lat, lng], ...) }` in position sync runs on EVERY position fix, overriding user's manual pan. **Fix:** Remove the else-if block entirely. Only center on initial zoom. Add a 🎯 recenter button instead. |
|| **Map remounts every tab switch** | All | `{tab === 'map' && (<RealMap />)}` causes React to unmount/remount the entire Leaflet map when switching away and back. **Fix:** Always render the map tab div, toggle visibility via `style={{ display: tab === 'map' ? '' : 'none' }}`. |
|| **GPS position drift bearing causes random arrow direction** | All | Computing `atan2(dLng, dLat)` from consecutive GPS positions at walking speed gives unreliable bearing (GPS noise ~5-10m). Arrow points in random direction when user stands or walks slowly. **Fix:** Remove bearing computation entirely. Arrow only updates from compass (`deviceHeading`) or Geolocation API `coords.heading`. Defaults to north (0°) when no source available. |
|| **Compass arrow jitters on large turns** | All | CSS `transition: 0.25s ease` on arrow rotation is longer than state throttle (100ms). Each new heading arrives before the previous transition completes, causing visible vibration. **Fix:** Change transition to `0.08s ease-out` (faster than 100ms throttle). Each transition completes before the next update. |

---

| 5.9 | **Geocode server proxy response format mismatch** | All | Client `processGeocodeQueue` parsed `data?.address` from `/api/geocode` response, but server proxy returns `{label, detail, full}` format — not raw Nominatim JSON. Caused `addr = {}` always → no district/suburb → "📍 未知地區" for every cell. **Fix:** Read `data.label` / `data.detail` / `data.full` directly from server response. |

## 11. Map Grid Flag & Highlight Bugs

### 11.1 Flags Not Appearing After Purchase

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🔴 Critical |
| **Symptom** | After buying a property, the 🚩 flag does not appear on the map. Refreshing the page shows it. |
| **Root Cause** | Flag code was inside `updateGrid()`, which only runs on map `moveend`/`zoomend`. After buying, `ownedCells` prop updates but `updateGrid()` is not called. Also `updateGrid()` clears all flags at the start, so even existing flags get wiped. |
| **Fix** | Extract flags into standalone `placeAllFlags(map)` function. Managed by `useEffect([ownedCells])` — fires on every owned cell change. |

### 11.2 Highlight Overwritten by Owned Cell Style

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🟡 Medium |
| **Symptom** | Standing on an owned cell: golden highlight is invisible, only owned-cell dim fill shows. |
| **Root Cause** | `isHighlightCell` `rect.setStyle()` ran BEFORE `isOwned` `rect.setStyle()`. Owned style overwrote highlight's `fillOpacity: 0.7` -> `0.2` and golden border. |
| **Fix** | Reverse order: owned check runs first, highlight runs second. Last `setStyle()` wins. |

### 11.3 Grid Not Rebuilt on `ownedCells` Change

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🟡 Medium |
| **Symptom** | After selling/unlisting a property, flag remains on map. |
| **Root Cause** | No `useEffect` watching `ownedCells`. Grid only rebuilds on `moveend`/`zoomend`. |
| **Fix** | Add `useEffect(() => { placeAllFlags(mapRef.current) }, [ownedCells])`. |

## 12. Trail Day Filter Pitfalls

### 12.1 `useEffect` Comparison Preventing Regeneration

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🟡 Medium |
| **Symptom** | Clicking a day in the weekly chart doesn't change the heatmap/trails visible — all days still show. |
| **Root Cause** | The `useEffect` syncing `trailDayFilter` prop had a `next !== prev` guard. On initial render, both `trailDayFilter` prop and `trailDayFilterRef.current` were `null`, so first effect run skipped. When prop changed to a day index, `prev` (from ref) was also `null`... but edge cases with SSR hydration caused stale comparisons. |
| **Fix** | Remove the `next !== prev` guard entirely. Always regenerate heatmap and show/hide polylines when the effect fires. |

### 12.2 Polyline Filter Without Heatmap

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🟡 Medium |
| **Symptom** | Clicking a day filters the heatmap overlay but the dashed trail polylines still show all days. |
| **Root Cause** | `generateTrailHeatmap(filterDay)` correctly aggregated only the filtered day's grid cells, but `polylineByDay` / `vehiclePolylineByDay` layers were not hidden. The polylines remained visible regardless of the filter. |
| **Fix** | Add `map.addLayer`/`map.removeLayer` logic for each polyline in the `trailDayFilter` useEffect. Use `map.hasLayer(poly)` guard to avoid redundant operations. |

### 12.3 Overview Toggle Resetting Day Filter

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🟡 Medium |
| **Symptom** | When trail overview (👣) toggles OFF, all polylines were restored, losing the day filter state. |
| **Root Cause** | `toggleTrailOverview` in OFF path called `polylineByDay.current.forEach(poly => map.addLayer(poly))` which restored ALL polylines regardless of filter. Also reset `trailDayFilterRef.current = null`. |
| **Fix** | Remove the restore-all-polylines code. Don't reset `trailDayFilterRef.current` in the OFF path. Day filter should persist in normal map mode too. |

### 12.4 Default Day Filter = Today

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🟢 Low (enhancement) |
| **Symptom** | On page load, all 7 days' trails were visible. User wanted only today's trails by default. |
| **Root Cause** | `useState<number \| null>(null)` — no default filter. |
| **Fix** | Change to `useState<number \| null>(new Date().getDay())`. On page load, only today's trail polylines are visible. Clicking today's bar again sets `null` to show all. |

### 12.5 Property Flags Tied to Grid Toggle (Not Day Filter)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🟡 Medium |
| **Symptom** | Clicking a day filter hides non-matching trail polylines, but 🏠 property flags remain visible on all owned cells regardless of filter. |
| **Root Cause** | `placeAllFlags()` creates all flags unconditionally on init — no coupling to grid visibility state. |
| **Fix (v0.35.3)** | Flags are now **exclusively tied to the grid toggle** (`gridVisible`), NOT day filter. `placeAllFlags()` is only called when grid toggle is ON. Day filter only affects trail polylines — flags show on ALL days (or none, depending on grid state). |
| **Key Insight** | Flags display owned cells, not visited cells. Day filter is for walking trails only. Mixing them was architecturally wrong. Store `flagMarkerByCell` for individual marker access, but control visibility through `gridVisibleRef.current` + grid toggle button handler. |

## 13. ModalPortal Animation Click Trap (Fixed v0.35.4)

### 13.1 Transparent Overlay Intercepts Clicks During Animation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🔴 Critical (cards unresponsive after 4-5 cycles) |
| **Symptom** | Opening/closing property cards 4-5 times causes all pet-grid cards to stop responding to clicks. Reloading the page fixes it temporarily. |
| **Root Cause** | Three interacting problems: (1) ModalPortal fade-in used `opacity: 0` → rAF → `opacity: 1`, creating a 16ms+ window where the overlay is transparent but present in the DOM. (2) CSS `.modal-portal-wrapper > * { pointer-events: auto }` gives grandchildren like `.fixed-modal-layer` `pointer-events: auto` — `pointer-events: none` does NOT cascade to descendants. (3) The rAF-based state machine accumulated timing race conditions over multiple cycles, eventually leaving the overlay in a state where it permanently blocked clicks to cards behind it. |
| **Fix (v0.35.4)** | Remove ALL animation logic from ModalPortal. Children render instantly via simple conditional: `children ? <div>{children}</div> : null`. No transition, no opacity animation, no rAF state machine. The 16ms invisible overlay window is eliminated entirely. |
| **Additional isolation (v0.36.0)** | Property Detail Modal is now rendered **inline** in `page.tsx` (not through ModalPortal), using a conditional `{detailProperty && (<div className="fixed-modal-layer">...)}` pattern. This eliminates any interaction between the property modal and ModalPortal's state machine. PetDetailModal, NotificationModal, ProfileModal, and other complex modals still use ModalPortal. |
| **Why no animation?** | The fade-in was purely cosmetic (< 300ms). Eliminating it removes an entire class of race-condition bugs at negligible UX cost. Verified with 30-cycle stress test at 50ms intervals — 100% pass rate. |
| **Prevention** | Any portal-based overlay system must guarantee ZERO invisible DOM elements that can intercept events. If animation is needed, use `display: none` + CSS `transition-delay` (not setTimeout/rAF) with proper `visibility` coordination. |

## 14. Cross-User Flag Visibility (Fixed v0.37.0)

### 14.1 Other Users' Flags Never Appear

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🟡 Medium (flags only shown for current user's cells) |
| **Symptom** | User A buys a cell → flag appears on User A's map. User B logs in → cannot see User A's flag even when zoomed in with grid enabled. |
| **Root Cause** | `placeAllFlags()` in RealMap.tsx read from `ownedCellsRef.current`, which was built from `loadProperties(userId)` — a Supabase query filtered by `user_id`. Only the current user's cells were ever returned, so flags only showed for cells owned by the logged-in account. |
| **Fix (v0.37.0)** | New API route `/api/properties/all-cells` fetches ALL occupied cells using `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (bypasses RLS). `loadUserProperties()` auto-refreshes this data after buy/sell. `placeAllFlags()` now iterates over `allFlagCellsRef.current` (`FlagCell[]` array) instead of `ownedCellsRef.current` (`Set<string>`). |
| **Files changed** | `route.ts` (new all-cells endpoint), `supabase-db.ts` (new `FlagCell` type + `fetchAllFlagCells()`), `page.tsx` (new `allFlagCells` state integrated into `loadUserProperties()`), `RealMap.tsx` (switched flag source to `allFlagCells`) |
| **Prevention** | Any feature that needs cross-user data (e.g. leaderboard, PvP, trade visibility) must use an API route with `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` — never rely on client-side Supabase queries which are subject to RLS. RLS only shows the current user's own rows unless specifically configured otherwise. |

## 15. D-Pad Interval Race Condition (Fixed v0.37.1)

### 15.1 onMouseDown Interval Never Fires Before onMouseUp

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🟠 High (D-pad appears usable but does nothing on click) |
| **Symptom** | Tapping any D-pad arrow button (▲◄►▼) yields no movement. Coordinates don't change. Holding the button for <150ms also does nothing. |
| **Root Cause** | `startManualWalk(dir)` created a `setInterval(updateFn, 150)` and set it as `manualWalkRef.current`. Button `onMouseDown` fired `startManualWalk`, but `onMouseUp` fired `stopManualWalk` within ~50ms — before the interval's first callback at 150ms. The interval was cleared before it ever executed, so `mapPos` was never updated. |
| **Fix (v0.37.1)** | Extracted `stepManualWalk(dir)` that calls `setMapPos()` **synchronously** on every press. `startManualWalk` now calls `stepManualWalk` immediately, then sets up the interval only for continued movement while held. Even a sub-150ms tap produces one position update. |
| **Files changed** | `apps/web/src/app/page.tsx` — added `stepManualWalk()`, refactored `startManualWalk()` to call it synchronously + start interval |
| **Prevention** | Any interaction pattern that uses `onMouseDown` to start an async timer + `onMouseUp` to cancel it must ensure the **first action is synchronous**. The timer should only add **repeat** behavior. Test with the shortest possible click/tap (not just held-down) to verify immediate response. On touch devices, also verify `onTouchStart`/`onTouchEnd` fire in the correct order (they do, but the same race condition applies). |

## 13. React State Batching — setState Inside Cross-Component Callback

### 13.1 Monster Encounter Modal Never Renders (setEncounter Called but State Not Applied)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🔴 Critical (monster encounter invisible) |
| **Symptom** | Walking into a monster cell triggers detection logic (console: `TRIGGERING ENCOUNTER!`), `setEncounter(monster)` is called inside the `monsterEncountered` callback, but the modal component (`{encounter && ...}` or `<MonsterModal encounter={encounter}>`) never renders. Console shows no `[Modal]` debug logs. |
| **Root Cause** | Unclear — appears to be a React 18 state-batching issue where `setState` called inside a `useCallback` (with `[]` deps) that was defined in parent component A but invoked from child component B's `useEffect` doesn't trigger a re-render in component A with the new state. The callback reference is stable (empty deps), `setEncounter` is a stable setState function, and the console confirms the callback body executes. But the parent component re-renders with `encounter` still `null`. `ReactDOM.createPortal` with the same condition also fails to render. |
| **Failed attempts** | 1. IIFE inline pattern `{encounter && (() => {...})()}` → no render<br>2. Separate `<MonsterModal>` component → no render<br>3. `ReactDOM.createPortal(conditional content, document.body)` → no render<br>4. Adding `walking` to useCallback deps → no change<br>5. Removing `walkStop()` from callback → no change<br>6. `useCallback(..., [])` vs `useCallback(..., [walking])` → no difference |
| **Fix (v0.37.3)** | Bypass React state entirely: call `showMonsterModal()` which uses **direct DOM manipulation** (`document.createElement('div')` + `innerHTML` + `appendChild`). The overlay is created imperatively in the callback, not via React rendering. Event listeners use `addEventListener`. Modal is closed via `overlay.remove()`. |
| **Files changed** | `apps/web/src/app/page.tsx` — replaced `setEncounter(monster)` with `showMonsterModal(monster, addStRef, logMsg)` |
| **Prevention** | When a React state update from a cross-component callback (parent useCallback → passed to child → called from child's useEffect) consistently fails to trigger a re-render with the new state, bypass the React rendering pipeline entirely with direct DOM manipulation for the specific UI element. This is a last resort — only after exhausting all React debugging approaches. |

## 14. GPS Auto-Restart & toggleManualMode Position Handling

### 14.1 `walkStop()` Destroys Position Before `setManualMode` Updater Runs

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🔴 Critical (D-pad always starts from hardcoded position, GPS never restarts) |
| **Symptom** | Toggle manual mode ON → D-pad always starts from (22.3194, 114.1694) regardless of real GPS position. Toggle manual mode OFF → map stays at last D-pad position (no longer snaps to null), but GPS never restarts — the 📡 開GPS button stays visible forever. The auto-GPS effect does not fire. |
| **Root Cause 1: Position cleared by walkStop** | `toggleManualMode()` calls `walkStop()` at the top, which calls `setMapPos(null)`. Then the `setManualMode(v => ...)` updater runs `setMapPos(prev => prev ?? { 22.3194, 114.1694 })`. Since `walkStop()` already set `prev=null`, the fallback always fires — the user's GPS position is lost. |
| **Root Cause 2: GPS never restarts** | The auto-GPS `useEffect(() => { if (tab==='map' && !walking) walkStart() }, [tab])` only depends on `[tab]`. When `walking` changes from `true` to `false` (manual mode OFF), the effect does **not** re-run (tab is still 'map' and `walking` is not a dep). So `walkStart()` is never called, and GPS stays off. |
| **Fix 1** | Save position to `manualPosRef` *before* `walkStop()`: `setMapPos(prev => { if (prev) manualPosRef.current = {lat: prev.lat, lng: prev.lng}; return prev })`. Then in the updater: `setMapPos({ lat: manualPosRef.current.lat, lng: manualPosRef.current.lng })`. |
| **Fix 2** | Add `walking` to the auto-GPS effect's dependency array: `useEffect(() => {...}, [tab, walking])`. When `walking` flips to `false`, the effect re-runs and calls `walkStart()`. |
| **Fix 3 (re-open manual mode from GPS)** | Save current position before each toggle. `manualPosRef` is always updated with the latest real position. When toggling ON again, read from `manualPosRef.current` — always starts from current GPS location, never from the old D-pad destination. |
| **Expected flow** | 1. Toggle ON → GPS position saved → walkStop() → position restored → D-pad starts from real GPS. 2. Toggle OFF → last D-pad position restored → auto-GPS effect re-runs (walking changed) → walkStart() → GPS fix updates position. 3. Toggle ON again → current GPS position used, not old D-pad position. |
| **Code** | `apps/web/src/app/page.tsx` — `toggleManualMode()`, auto-GPS `useEffect` |
| **Prevention** | Always think about the **full lifecyle** of state across toggle sequences: (1) Saving state before mutation, (2) Restoring state after mutation, (3) Side-effects (like GPS restart) that depend on the toggled state. Use a checklist: "What happens at T=0, T=toggle-ON, T=toggle-OFF, T=toggle-ON-again?" |
| **Related** | `walkStop()` is a general-purpose cleanup function — it aggressively resets `mapPos`, `walking`, and `movementMode` to default/null. Any function that calls `walkStop()` and then attempts to restore specific state must save that state *before* calling `walkStop()`, because `walkStop()` mutates shared state synchronously. |

### 14.2 Phantom Trail on First GPS Fix (Trail Starts from Nowhere)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🟡 Medium (misleading trail appearance) |
| **Symptom** | When the app first loads, a trail line appears connecting "nowhere" to the first GPS position. The initial zoom animation (fitBounds → flyTo) shows this phantom line. The trail appears to start from a random location, not from where the user actually started walking. |
| **Root Cause** | The position `useEffect` in RealMap checks `walking && (mode === 'walk' || 'vehicle')` and always adds a trail point. On the FIRST GPS fix, `walking=true` and `mode='walk'`, so a trail point is added at the GPS location. This creates a trail with just one point, which Leaflet renders as a line from some default position. Additionally, the initial zoom animation (`map.fitBounds()` of all existing trails + `map.flyTo()`) visually emphasizes this phantom point. |
| **Fix** | Add `trailStartedRef = useRef(false)`. Guard trail drawing with `trailStartedRef.current`. Set `trailStartedRef.current = true` AFTER the first position update's trail-drawing block (outside the `if (walking...)` guard). The first position update skips trail drawing entirely; subsequent updates draw normally. |
| **Code** | `apps/web/src/components/RealMap.tsx` — line 136 (`trailStartedRef`), line 1070 (guard), line 1113 (`= true`) |
| **Prevention** | Any position-based drawing system (trails, markers, paths) must handle the "first position" case specially. Common patterns: (a) Skip drawing on the first update entirely, (b) Use a "first draw" flag that's set after the first update completes. The key insight is that the first position is a GPS cold-start fix, not a movement update — it represents "where you are now", not "where you moved to". |

### 15 — Random Shops System Bugs (v0.39.x)

### 15.1 Position Effect Shop Check Ignores Lifetime Map — Expired Shops Still Trigger

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🟡 Medium (expired shop can still be entered) |
| **Symptom** | When a shop's countdown reaches 0, the 🏪 badge disappears from the grid. But if the player is standing on the same cell, walking into it still triggers the shop modal — the expired shop is still interactable. |
| **Root Cause** | The position `useEffect`'s shop check calls `getShopForCell(row, col, ownedSetLocal)` **without** passing `shopLifetimeRef.current`. This means the expiry check is skipped: `getShopForCell` checks `if (shopLifetimeMap)` before reading expiry, and since no map is passed, it always creates a new shop with a fresh `expiresAt`. Meanwhile, `placeShopsOnGrid` correctly passes `shopLifetimeRef.current`, so the grid correctly hides expired shops. |
| **Fix** | Pass `shopLifetimeRef.current` to `getShopForCell` in the position useEffect shop check. |
| **Code** | `apps/web/src/components/RealMap.tsx` — line 1278 |
| **Prevention** | When a function has two call sites that should behave identically, both must receive the same optional parameters. The `getShopForCell` signature requires `shopLifetimeMap?` — but only the grid rendering call passed it. Audit all call sites when adding optional state-dependent parameters to a shared function. |

### 15.2 Shared `encounteredMonstersRef` Between Monsters and Shops

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🟡 Medium (cell with both monster and shop only triggers monster) |
| **Symptom** | A cell can have both a monster (18% rate) and a shop (12% rate) because they use different hash seeds. ~2.16% of monster cells also have a shop. When the player walks in, only the monster encounter triggers; the shop is silently skipped. |
| **Root Cause** | Both the monster check and the shop check use the same `encounteredMonstersRef.current.has(cellKey)` guard. The monster check runs first, adds the cellKey to the set. The shop check immediately after sees the set contains the key and skips. |
| **Fix** | (Low priority) Use separate dedup sets for monsters and shops, or check shops first, or allow both to trigger in sequence. |
| **Workaround** | The shop will be available on the grid but never trigger inside the cell encounter effect. The player can still see the shop icon on the grid, but if a monster also exists on that cell, the monster takes priority. |
| **Prevention** | Shared dedup sets must be carefully reviewed when adding new entity types to the same detection mechanism. Consider whether entities are mutually exclusive or can coexist. |

### 15.3 Shop Lifetime Reset on Page Refresh

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🟢 Low (minor UX inconsistency) |
| **Symptom** | After refreshing the page, all shops get a new countdown timer. Previously expired shops reappear. Previously active shops get extended lifetimes. |
| **Root Cause** | `shopLifetimeRef` is a `useRef<Map<string, number>>` that stores `cellKey → expiresAt`. Refs are reset on page reload. When `getShopForCell` is called after refresh, there's no cached `expiresAt` in the map, so it generates a new one (`Date.now() + deterministic_duration`). |
| **Fix** | (Long-term) Persist shop lifetimes to `localStorage` with a key like `pipz_shop_expiry_{cellKey}`. On mount, restore from localStorage. Clean up expired entries periodically. |
| **Workaround** | None needed — lifetimes are 15-45 minutes, so a page refresh within that window is rare. The deterministic duration ensures the same cell always has the same expiry rule, just shifted by the time of first discovery. |
| **Prevention** | Any "time-until-expiry" feature using in-memory refs will lose state on page refresh. If persistence matters, use localStorage or a server-side timestamp. |

### 15.4 Grid Icon Badge Clutter

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🟢 Low (visual density) |
| **Symptom** | The shop marker icon has two badges: discount % (top-right, colored) and countdown `MM:SS` (bottom-right, dark). At 30×30 pixel size, the badges are very small and overlap visually. |
| **Root Cause** | Both badges are positioned on the right side of the icon: top-right for discount, bottom-right for countdown. With icon size 30×30 and font sizes 7-8px, the badges occupy a significant portion of the icon. |
| **Fix** | Consider: (a) Move countdown to the left side (bottom-left), (b) Merge into a single badge (e.g. `50%·25m`), (c) Only show one badge at a time (discount if > 5min, countdown if < 5min), (d) Increase icon size to 34×34. |
| **Workaround** | Current implementation works but looks crowded. The countdown is more important for time-critical shops, while the discount is more important for decision-making. Priority-based display might be better. |
| **Prevention** | When adding multiple data elements to a small DOM element, test at the actual rendered size. 30×30 pixels is very small for two separate badges. Consider combining or alternating displays. |

## 16 — Expandable Steps Card Drag System (v0.39.x)

### 16.1 Cumulative `dy` Clamp → Card Jumps to 0 on Down-Drag

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🔴 Critical (drag unusable) |
| **Symptom** | Touching the card and dragging down causes the card to instantly snap to its collapsed height instead of following the finger. |
| **Root Cause** | `onMove` computed `dy = startY - currentY` (cumulative from touch point), then `Math.max(0, Math.min(MAX, dy))` clamped negative `dy` to 0. Any downward finger movement immediately set `cardDragY = 0`. |
| **Fix** | Switch to incremental tracking: `deltaY = prevMoveY - ev.clientY`, then `newExtra = cardDragYRef.current + deltaY`. Each call adds/subtracts the small movement since the last pointermove, so the card smoothly rises or falls by exactly the finger's displacement. |
| **Code** | `apps/web/src/app/page.tsx` — `onMove` closure in `onPointerDown`, line ~2151 |
| **Prevention** | For finger-follow drag, always use **incremental delta** (`current - previous`, then add to running state). Never use **cumulative distance from start** unless the operation is purely one-directional. The cumulative approach fails when the user reverses direction. |

### 16.2 Tap Toggle Collapses Expanded Card

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🟠 Medium (unexpected behavior) |
| **Symptom** | After dragging the card up to expand, any subsequent tap on the card collapses it again. User must keep tapping to keep the card open. |
| **Root Cause** | `onUp` tap branch used `currentY > 20 ? 0 : MAX` — a toggle that reads `cardDragYRef.current`. If the card was expanded (>20), tap set it to 0 (collapsed). The user expected the card to stay expanded after the drag release. |
| **Fix** | Change tap behavior: `setCardDragY(CARD_MAX_EXTRA)` unconditionally. Collapsed → expands; already expanded → React state is the same → React bailout (no re-render, no visual change). |
| **Code** | `apps/web/src/app/page.tsx` — `onUp` closure, line ~2165 |
| **Prevention** | After a drag action, the natural next action is NOT a toggle. Users tap to interact with content, not to toggle the container. Consider whether tap-to-toggle is truly desired on expanded containers. |

### 16.3 `cardDragYRef.current` Not Updated in Tap Path

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🟠 Medium (tap-toggle always expands, never collapses) |
| **Symptom** | After tapping to expand, the next tap also expands (no-op) instead of collapsing. The ref still reads `currentY = 0`, causing the toggle condition to always decide "expand". |
| **Root Cause** | `cardDragYRef.current` was only updated inside `onMove` (during drag). The tap branch in `onUp` called `setCardDragY(target)` (React state) but never updated `cardDragYRef.current`. Next tap read the stale ref value. |
| **Fix** | Set `cardDragYRef.current = target` in both tap and drag branches of `onUp`. |
| **Code** | `apps/web/src/app/page.tsx` — `onUp`, line ~2165-2175 |
| **Prevention** | Any time you have a ref + state pair tracking the same value (`cardDragYRef + cardDragY` for closure access), updates to one must always mirror to the other. Audit all paths that call `setState(value)` and ensure the ref is also updated. |

### 16.4 Fixed Pixel Threshold for Snap Decision

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🟡 Medium (inconsistent snap behavior across screen sizes) |
| **Symptom** | On phones with small viewports (CARD_MAX_EXTRA ~80px), the `> 70px` threshold required dragging nearly 90% of the full range before the card would snap to expanded on release. On large screens (MAX ~200px), `> 70px` was too easy to pass. |
| **Root Cause** | Hardcoded threshold `currentY > 70` did not scale with `CARD_MAX_EXTRA` (which depends on `window.innerHeight * 0.52 - contentHeight`). |
| **Fix** | Use direction-based snap instead of threshold: `cardDragDirRef.current` tracks `'up'`/`'down'` on every pointermove > 8px. On release, snap to `MAX` if last direction was `'up'`, `0` if `'down'`. |
| **Code** | `apps/web/src/app/page.tsx` — `cardDragDirRef` (line ~81), `onMove` direction tracking (line ~2154), `onUp` snap (line ~2173) |
| **Prevention** | Avoid hardcoded pixel thresholds for proportionally-sized interactions. Use ratios (50%) or direction-based logic instead. |

### 16.5 `contentRef` Measuring Flex-Allocated Height (Circular)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🟡 Medium (card height never adjusts to actual content) |
| **Symptom** | The card's collapsed height was stuck at the initial hardcoded value (~300px) even after content changed (chart loaded/hidden). |
| **Root Cause** | `contentRef` was placed on the `flex: 1; overflow: hidden` div. `getBoundingClientRect().height` returned the **flex-allocated** height (= `cardHeight - handleH - navH = contentH + cardDragY`), not the **content** height. This created a circular dependency where `contentH` always equaled itself. |
| **Fix** | Add a dedicated inner `<div>` (`innerRef`) inside the flex wrapper, wrapping only the numbers + chart. Measure `innerRef.current.getBoundingClientRect().height` — this is the true content height unaffected by flex distribution. |
| **Code** | `apps/web/src/app/page.tsx` — `innerRef` added, `contentRef` removed, height formula uses `innerH` |
| **Prevention** | Never measure the height of a `flex: 1` or `flex-grow` element and use that measurement to set its own parent's height — the measurement is the result of flex distribution, not the cause. Measure a child wrapper that sizes to its own content. |

### 16.6 iOS `touch-action: none` Ignored on Non-Root Elements

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🟡 Medium (touch drag does not work on iPhone/iPad) |
| **Symptom** | On iOS Safari, touching the card triggers page scroll instead of card drag. `touch-action: none` CSS on the card element is ignored. |
| **Root Cause** | iOS Safari only respects `touch-action: none` on the `<html>` root element. On non-root elements, CSS `touch-action` is not supported, so touch events bubble up to the document and trigger scroll. |
| **Fix** | Add native `touchstart`/`touchmove` event listeners on the card element with `{ passive: false }` and call `e.preventDefault()` + `e.stopPropagation()`. This blocks iOS scroll before it starts. Attach/detach via `useEffect` + `cardRef`. |
| **Code** | `apps/web/src/app/page.tsx` — `cardRef` `useEffect` (line ~325) |
| **Prevention** | For touch-interactive elements on iOS, always add native `touchstart`/`touchmove` listener with `preventDefault()`. CSS `touch-action` alone is insufficient on iOS. Use both for cross-browser compatibility. |

## 17 — Tabbed Card Content (v0.40.0)

### 17.1 `cardTab` vs `tab` State Split — Page Navigation Lost

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🔴 Critical (features disappeared) |
| **Symptom** | Adding a separate `cardTab` state for the card's tab content caused all 5 bottom nav buttons to lose their page-navigation behavior. Clicking 🐾 only changed the card preview instead of navigating to the full pets page. Entire feature pages (pets, community, inventory) became inaccessible. |
| **Root Cause** | The nav buttons' `onClick` was changed from `setTab(t.k)` to `setCardTab(t.k)`. `tab` (the page-level routing state) was never updated. The existing page-level content (`{tab === 'pets' && (...) }`) depended on `tab` being set, so it never rendered. |
| **Fix** | Card buttons must ONLY set `cardTab`, not `tab`. For full-page navigation, add explicit "詳細" buttons inside the extended content section of each tab. `cardTab` controls the card preview; `tab` remains a user-initiated navigation (via "詳細" buttons or event-triggered navigation like egg found). |
| **Code** | `apps/web/src/app/page.tsx` — nav button `onClick` (line ~2400): `onClick={() => setCardTab(t.k)}` |
| **Prevention** | When adding a new state that replaces part of an existing state's responsibility, audit every consumer of the original state. `tab` was read in 10+ places, not just the nav buttons. A state-splitting change must update ALL consumers or keep both states in sync. |

### 17.2 Map Forced Visible — Non-Map Tabs Show Map Background

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🟠 Medium (non-map tabs rendered over the map, visual chaos) |
| **Symptom** | The map container was changed from `display: tab === 'map' ? 'flex' : 'none'` to always `display: 'flex'`. When switching to the pets tab, the full-page pet content rendered ON TOP of the map, creating overlapping layouts. |
| **Root Cause** | The map container used `position: fixed` with `z-index: 1`. Making it always visible meant it occupied screen space even when the pets/community/inventory pages were shown. Those pages (also `position: fixed` with their own containers) overlapped. |
| **Fix** | Revert to conditional display: `display: tab === 'map' ? 'flex' : 'none'`. The map is only visible when the map tab is active. Other tabs show their full-page content without a map background. |
| **Code** | `apps/web/src/app/page.tsx` — map container `style.display` (line ~2135) |
| **Prevention** | Never unconditionally show a `position: fixed` overlay that was designed to be conditional. Any change from "show on tab X" to "always show" must verify all overlapping elements. `position: fixed` elements stack in DOM order. |

### 17.3 New Tab Content Appeared Without User Request

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🟢 Low (unexpected UI elements) |
| **Symptom** | The card started showing pet preview, property stats, community info, and backpack preview when those tabs were clicked. The user was surprised by new UI elements that weren't there before. |
| **Root Cause** | The `cardTab` content (5 switch-case previews) was added in a single patch. Each tab's Preview section was implemented before the user confirmed the design direction. The user expected only the map tab's steps content at this stage. |
| **Fix** | Keep the tab content but ensure the page-level navigation still works (`setTab` alongside `setCardTab`). The card previews are additive — they don't break existing functionality. |
| **Code** | `apps/web/src/app/page.tsx` — card inner content switches by `cardTab` (lines ~2200-2385) |
| **Prevention** | When introducing new UI elements visible to the user, match the pace of user expectations. A single patch that adds both a new state AND 5 new visual sections is harder to roll back. Implement the state first, then add content incrementally per user confirmation. |

### 17.4 Bottom Nav Doesn't Sync cardTab — Map Shows Pet Content After Return

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🔴 Critical (wrong content on map tab) |
| **Symptom** | User clicks 🐾 in the card bottom nav → navigates to pets full page → clicks 🗺️ in the bottom nav to return to map → the card shows **pet preview** instead of steps. The map "remembers" the last cardTab. |
| **Root Cause** | Two separate nav button implementations exist: (a) `card-nav` buttons inside the map card (set `cardTab`), and (b) `bottom-nav` buttons shown on non-map pages (set `tab`). When the user navigated to pets via card buttons (set `cardTab='pets', tab='pets'`) and returned via bottom nav buttons (only set `tab='map'`), `cardTab` remained `'pets'`. React re-renders with `tab='map'` (map visible) + `cardTab='pets'` → card shows pet content. |
| **Fix** | Both nav sets must set both states. Card nav: `onClick={() => { setCardTab(t.k); setTab(t.k); }}`. Bottom nav: `onClick={() => { setTab(t.k); setCardTab(t.k); }}`. The state update order differs depending on which nav was already the primary driver, but the end state is the same. |
| **Code** | `apps/web/src/app/page.tsx` — card nav buttons (line ~2420) and bottom nav buttons (line ~2990) |
| **Prevention** | When two overlapping state variables (`tab` and `cardTab`) are set by different UI elements, every `setTab` call must also update `cardTab` and vice versa. Audit all call sites whenever adding a parallel state. There were 9 call sites for `setTab` and 1 for `setCardTab`; only the primary nav buttons were updated initially, missing the bottom nav. |

### 17.5 Map Extended Content Contains Unwanted Stats

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | 🟢 Low (annoyance) |
| **Symptom** | When pulling up the map tab's extended content (revealed by card drag), the user sees "已佔領地", "插旗點", "寵物狀態" stats that they didn't ask for. The map details row was added without user confirmation. |
| **Root Cause** | The map tab's extended section was designed as a dashboard-like space. The developer added a 3-column stats row (owned cells, flag cells, pet status) as "useful map data" during the initial implementation of tab content, without checking if the user wanted these visible. |
| **Fix** | Remove the entire 3-column row from the map extended content. Only the weekly bar chart remains in the map tab's extended section. |
| **Code** | `apps/web/src/app/page.tsx` — lines ~2320-2334 (deleted in v0.40.2) |
| **Prevention** | Never add visible UI elements that the user hasn't requested or confirmed, especially on a production app where the user is actively testing. A "show more" dynamic content system should be additive: start minimal, add per request. |
